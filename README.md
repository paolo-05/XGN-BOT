# This was kind of a big project I made during 2021, it included a full of features discord bot made in python, and a web site for server to server managment made in react js. Since the developer of discord.py (the python library that the bot was based on) discontinued its update. I closed the web site and all the data in my server was erased. Now, the code its pubblic, it will not run if you clone this repo and try.
