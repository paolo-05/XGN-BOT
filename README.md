# ‚ùì What is `xgn-bot`

> xgn-bot **was** a discord bot made by me during 2021. As I started to gain experience with python, I discoverd that it was possible to code my own bot for discord, which I really enjoied doing, but in the mean time I also discovered [MEE6](https://mee6.xyz/en) the most complete bot out there, so I took inspiration on that project.

# üî• Features

The bot was very feature rich, including a wide range of categories:
- music commands
- moderaton commands
- welcome/leave messages (customizable via the website)
- slash commands
- levelling system
- online leaderboard based on levels
- games to play in the discord chat

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è Why it was discontinued

In the late part of the 2021 the creator and mainteiner of `discord.py` announced that he will eventually stop working on the library because discord was making a big change in its api, [go here for more informations](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord.py), so as I read about these announcements I decided that writing the bot in another language like `js` wasn't a thing for me, so I decided to stop paying for the server and I sell the domain.

_XGN-BOT someday could be restored at its prime, but for now it's a wonderful memory of my first experiences as a programmer._

# üìñ Background story

By using the `discord py` library it was a quite easy operation to develop the first utility commands, for banning users or kicking them. But with time I wanted more and I ended up implementing several API like the `urban dictionary` or the [`some random api`](https://some-random-api.ml/) which allowed me to make some entertainment commands. Futher more I implemented some games like `Rock Paper Scissors` or `Tic Tac Toe` by using a new type of event given by the discord API related to buttons. In the mean time I started working on a levelling system, quite a common thing for a discord bot, this required a database instance and I went for the sqlite option. 

But it wasn't enough for me. I was always looking at mee6 bot, wondering why it was so succesful, I didn't keep in mind that behind it there was a full team of engeneers, designers and marketing experts, and my bot was self hosted on my second pc and I had to turn it off in the night.

I couldn't stand with that so I purchased a domain `xgn-bot.xyz` and rent for ‚Ç¨ 6 a month a virtual linux server to keep always keep it on. I was a newbie on linux and I didn't knew anything about it. 

So I started my linux adventure, had to figure out how to set up a proxy and other boring things, but by the start of the 2021 summer I got the bot working `24/7` and a very first version of what I call a dashboard. It was made with `Flask` and plain `html` with `Boostrap 5`, but I wasn't satisfied and I discovered `React` so I started to work on that trying to convert the plain html to react compatible code.
